The part you have indicated (using its part number) has been moved to a "sold" folder in your parts root folder.  If you've made a mistake, don't worry!  Simply navigate to the sold folder, find the part you've entered, remove the "sold" and "price" text that has been added to the directory name, and move the directory back to the box it came from.  If you do not remember which box file the part was from, simply read the "description" file in the directory which contains the box number.
